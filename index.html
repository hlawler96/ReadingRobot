    <h2>Goal of the Game</h2>
        <section>
        <p>The main goal of the game is for K-2 kids with learning disabilities to learn to read by playing through a series of increasingly difficult mini games. Most of the games will encorporate a reading comprehension section that will either ask kids to click on words that they hear through the speaker or ask them to say words that appear on the screen. Some mini games that we are currently considering making are: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tug of War</li>
            <li>Tapping Game</li>
            <li>Hop Scotch</li>
            <li>Word Search</li>
            <li>Maze</li>
            <li>Color in pictures by words</li>
            <li>Racing Game</li>
            <li>Simple Math problems/Number recognition</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As they move through the levels the players robot will be given upgrades/items that will provide a reinforcement for playing through the levels. The plot of the game will be a light hearted adventure that puts a tiny kid robot up against older and larger robots, throwing them in the mud on the completion of certain level sets. There will be a final boss at the end after which the young robot will be declared the winner of the group or something to that effect.</p>
        </section>
    <h2>Key Mechanisms</h2>
        <p>The game will have the user select levels for different mini games and allow them to navigate through different robot bosses. The user will gain items/prizes as they navigate through the level sets, eventually leading them to a final boss level. As they proceed through the levels the game will keep track of statistics and have a parental dashboard available to help track progress and highlight areas to improve in. </p>
